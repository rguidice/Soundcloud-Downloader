# Soundcloud-Downloader

### Description: 

This python script is meant to automate the process I use for downloading songs from SoundCloud. This process could be much more streamlined through use of the SoundCloud API, but they unfortunately aren't giving out API keys at the moment. If they become available, I would like to give this project another glance, as avoiding selenium and sending requests directly through their API would make this script much more efficient. On the topic of efficiency, this script could certainly be improved without the use of the SoundCloud API, and I will be working on improving it in the future.

### Use:

In order to use this script yourself, please make sure you change the directory in lines 16, 23, 47 and 81. Please note that since I made this to model my exact workflow, there will be some quirks (like track numbering) that you may want to modify or remove to meet your needs.
